TO DO: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS: 
1. Add a client database
   -> Track who has what
   -> Track who has an account
   -> Check if client has account
   -> Block checkouts if client has overdue books
   -> Add renewals
2. Catalog Improvements
   -> add/remove books to catalog
   -> view all in alphabetical function
3. Finish file stream out
   


** Create a sorting function to sort list based on the hashed values.**
** Use middle value as the root insert for the balanced bst ** 


1. Create text files (2) for book catalog and borrowed catalog
2. Create function implementations.
3. Divide up tasks between members.
4. Finish implementing code.
5. Test and finish paper + presentation slides. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Points to keep in mind from canvas: 
This will be a group project: There will be two groups splitting the class in two.

Deliverables:

1. Code (40 pts: Breakdown will be by feature you submit.  For example if your project includes a data structure, a sorting algorithm, a search algorithm and a class hierarchy, I will divide the 40 pts by 4 where each listed item will be graded based on 10 pts )

2. Documentation: APA Style Paper as describe in the course. (35 pts: Intro 5pts, procedure 10pts, Discussion 15 pts, conclusion 5pts Paper is individual)

3.  Class Presentation: Power Points (25 pts: Present as a group, each will get up to 25 pts.)  You will submit your Power Point to the Final Project Presentation section on Canvas. (Presentation in class).

4.  Your code and paper will be submitted here.

Steps for group work:

1. Pick your teammates and make sure that you have worked out all details for communications and versioning of your collective code.

2. Pick a topic based on your group discussions and evaluate the merits of your options before finalizing your choice.

3. Set a schedule to work together on campus, in class and online.

4. Make sure that you keep track of the group members participation by allocating specific tasks to be completed with deadlines

5. Work together and compromise; group dynamics are important in real world settings. 

Steps for individual work (If it applies):

1. Pick a topic that will require a data structure such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, dictionaries, or a combination for implementation.

2. Make sure that the implementation is OOP in nature

3. You must have features such as sorting and searching at minimum.

4. You're subject to the same deadlines as the group project teams.

5.  Submit code, paper and present at the same time as the teams (See deliverables above). 

Scope for grading and assessment :

Make sure that your project maps to our course learning objectives and outcomes:

1. Identify early on, the techniques that you will use based on the data structure of choice that you as a group agreed upon. (ABET Outcome 1)

2. STL authorized (ABET Outcome 2)

3. All code must be OOP (ABET Outcome 2)

4. All code must be original (No copying or copy and paste from any source, failure to do so is an automatic fail for the course)

5. All papers must have work cited and a reference page (a failing grade  for the assignment will be issued if these are missing). (ABET Outcome 3)

6. You must have a minimum of 5 test cases where you analyze the performance of your application based on various input data. (ABET Outcome 4)

7. In your documentation, describe the various roles you undertook as a team leader, team member and make sure that you demonstrate how you measured your performance

in terms of project planning, team discussions and tasks allocations, effort and workload.  Do include your strength and weaknesses during these processes (Will not effect your grade negatively).  (ABET Outcome 5)

This project is followed with a class presentation (See Canvas for details)
